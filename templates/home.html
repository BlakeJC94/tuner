    <h3>What is Tuner?</h3>
    <p>
        Tuner is a web application to help Spotify users find other users who have a similar music
        taste. Music taste is quantified by the frequency of genre tags amongst a users top artists,
        which can be compared amongst other users.
    </p>
    <p>
        After running Tuner, we'll find another user who's used Tuner who has a similar music taste
        to you. We'll present what genres and top artists you both enjoy, and we'll suggest some
        similar artists for you based on this match! Learn more about the project <a href="https://www.probableodyssey.blog/all-posts/tuner/">here</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Data privacy is important to us, we only store your top artists and your Spotify profile URL
        so that future users may discover artists they may be interested in based on your unique
        music taste.
